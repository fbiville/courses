= Project Setup
:order: 0
:go-version: 1.17.7

As part of this course, you will work on a link:https://github.com/{repository}[pre-built repository^] for the fictional client **Neoflix**.
The course is designed to be framework agnostic, so although we have chosen a specific framework, the tasks that you will perform will be the same regardless of your choice of framework.

In the early stages you will learn some of the theory required and then use that knowledge to implement a set of features in the API.


== Repository Information

We have built a repository that takes care of the boiler plate, so you can focus on implementing the functionality.

* The project is designed to work with a recent Go version
* Dependencies are managed with Go modules
* A web server has been built using the `net/http` package of the standard library
** Authentication is handled with link:https://jwt.io/[JWT Tokens^] encoded and decoded with the link:https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4/[github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4] dependency
** Passwords are encrypted and verified with link:https://golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt/[golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt^]
** Testing is performed using the `testing` package of the standard library


== Get Started

In the next lesson, we will walk through the prerequisites, clone the project and start the server.
