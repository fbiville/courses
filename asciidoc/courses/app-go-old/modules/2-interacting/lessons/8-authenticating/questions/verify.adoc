= Verifying the Test

This test creates a new `:User` node in the database with an email address of `authenticated@neo4j.com` using the `Save()` method on the `AuthService` and then attempts to verify the user using the `FindOneByEmailAndPassword()` method.

Hit the **Check Database** button below to verify that the test has been successfully run.

====
At the end of the test, a piece of code finds the User node and sets the `authenticatedAt` property to the current date and time using the Cypher `datetime()` function.
As long as this value is within the past 24 hours, the test should pass.

You can run the following query to check for the user within the database.
If the `shouldVerify` value returns true, the verification should be successful.
