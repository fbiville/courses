= 2. Finding people born in the seventies.

We want to write a `MATCH` clause  to retrieve all _Person_ nodes for people born in the seventies.

Select the `WHERE` clauses below that will filter this query properly:

MATCH (a:Person)
// WHERE clause
RETURN a.name, a.born


* [x] `+WHERE a.born >= 1970 AND a.born < 1980+`
* [x] `+WHERE 1970 <= a.born  < 1980+`
* [ ] `+WHERE 1970 < a.born  <= 1980+`
* [x] `+WHERE a.born IN [1970,1971,1972,1973,1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979]+`

.Solution
====
The following answers are the recommended ways of finding a number between two values:

`+WHERE a.born >= 1970 AND a.born < 1980+`

`+WHERE 1970 <= a.born  < 1980+`

This answer is technically correct, but the above methods are more efficient:

`+WHERE a.born IN [1970,1971,1972,1973,1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979]+`

This answer is incorrect, as the predicate is looking for numbers **greater than 1970** (eg 1971 and onwards) rather than **greater than or equal to** 1970 inclusive.

`+WHERE 1970 < a.born  <= 1980+`
