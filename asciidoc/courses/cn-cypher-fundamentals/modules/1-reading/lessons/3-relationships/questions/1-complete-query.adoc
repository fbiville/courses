= 1. Specifying the relationship direction

Say we wrote our query above differently and started with the _Movie_ node.
Use the dropdown below to select the correct direction for the query.

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.


[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)/*select:<-[:ACTED_IN]-*/(p:Person)
RETURN m.title, p.name
----


* [ ] `+-[:ACTED_IN]->+`
* [x] `+<-[:ACTED_IN]-+`


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
When you specify a direction for a relationship in a query, the query engine only looks for nodes that have that direction in their relationships when the relationship was created.

If you specify `+-[:ACTED_IN]-+` in the pattern, it doesn't matter how the relationships are created in the graph.

How is the relationship defined between _Person_ nodes and _Movie_ nodes?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
In our graph, the `:ACTED_IN` relationship always goes **from** a `:Person` node **to** a `:Movie` node.

As the `:Movie` node is defined as the first node in the pattern, the answer you are looking for is `<-[:ACTED_IN]-`.
