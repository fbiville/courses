[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----

/*select:DELETE p*/
----


* [ ] `DELETE p`

.Hint
====
You must delete relationships then the node.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
`DETACH DELETE p` is the correct answer.

If you were to attempt `DELETE p`, it would fail because it has relationships and Cypher prevents you from deleting nodes without first deleting its relationships.

There is no `REMOVE p` clause in Cypher.
