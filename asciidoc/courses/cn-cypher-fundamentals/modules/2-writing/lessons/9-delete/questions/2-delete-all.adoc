= 2. Cleaning up graph

Which Cypher code deletes all nodes and relationships from the graph?

* [x] `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`
* [ ] `DELETE NODES, RELATIONSHIPS`
* [ ] `MATCH (n) DELETE n`
* [ ] `DELETE ALL`

.Hint
====
Which code retrieves all nodes in the graph?
You must delete the nodes safely by deleting the relationships first.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
`MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` is the correct answer as it first deletes relationships to/from a node, then the node.

`MATCH (n) DELETE n` will fail because you cannot delete nodes without first deleting the relationships.

There are no such clauses `DELETE NODES, RELATIONSHIPS` and `DELETE ALL` in Cypher.
