.Hint
====
Make sure the _Movie_ node exists for _Get Out_.
Use MATCH to find the _Movie_ node and then use SET to add the properties using the reference to the node.
Use a comma (,) to separate the properties you are adding.

For example:
MATCH (x.Label)
SET x.firstProp = "xxx", x.secondProp = yyy

You  can do a subsequent MATCH to confirm that the node's properties have been set:
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'})
RETURN m

If you view the node in table view, you will see the properties.

Hint: the released property is an integer, not a string.
