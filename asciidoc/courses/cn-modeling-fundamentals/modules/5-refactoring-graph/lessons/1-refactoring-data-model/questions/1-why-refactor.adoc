[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
You may want to refactor if any of the use cases **cannot be answered**, or if another use case has been added.
It it also important to ensure that the data model **scales effectively** and still provides data in a timely fashion.

As long as the data model stays the same, you **do not need to refactor the graph** specifically when updating or adding new data.
