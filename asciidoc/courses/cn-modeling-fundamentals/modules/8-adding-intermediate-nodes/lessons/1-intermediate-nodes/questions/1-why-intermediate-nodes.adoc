= Refactoring with Intermediate nodes

Why do you refactor to create intermediate nodes?

* [x] Connect more than two nodes in a single context.
* [x] Share data in the graph.
* [x] Relate something to a relationship.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
Creating intermediate nodes allows for **two or more nodes to connect in a single context**, for example, a User may rate a movie via the company's website or mobile app.

That information can also be **shared**, allowing you to query through an element that used to be siloed within a relationship.

Extracting a relationship into a node is also referred to as **relating something to a relationship**.

This, however, **will not reduce the number of relationships in the graph**.  The size of the graph will only get bigger.
