In the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] course, we cover how to query Neo4j using a language called Cypher.
To execute a Cypher statement against a Neo4j database you will use an object called a *Driver*.

To connect to and query Neo4j from within a Go application, you use the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/go[Neo4j Go Driver^].


== Installing the Driver

The Neo4j Go Driver can be installed using the `go get` command.

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/README.adoc[tag=install]


== Importing the Library

The `github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver` package exports a `neo4j` object which contains several helper functions for interacting with Neo4j.


.Importing The Driver
[source,go,indent=0,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=import]
----

== Creating a Driver Instance

The most prominent helper function on the `neo4j` object is the `.NewDriverWithContext()` function, which accepts neo4j credentials and returns a new driver object.

.Creating a Driver Instance
[source,go,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=driver]
----

The function expects two arguments;

1. A Connection URI - for example, `neo4j://localhost:7687` or `neo4j+s://dbhash.databases.neo4j.io`
2. An authentication _token_
// 3. Optionally, link:https://neo4j.com/docs/api/Go-driver/current/function/index.html#static-function-driver[additional driver configuration^].


[TIP]
.Authentication Types
====
Neo4j supports four authentication methods, basic authentication (e.g. username and password or LDAP), a base64 encoded Bearer token, a Kerberos token, or a custom authentication token.
For more information on these options, visit link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/[Authentication and Authorization^].
====


=== Verifying Connectivity

You can verify that the connection details used during driver instantiation are correct by calling the `VerifyConnectivity()` method.

This function returns a Promise which throws a `Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized` error if the provided credentials are incorrect.

.Verify Connectivity

----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=verify]
----

== Sessions

From the Driver object, you will open one or more **sessions**.
A session is a client-side abstraction that borrows underlying TCP connections from a _connection pool_ held by the Driver and uses them to communicate with Neo4j.

Sessions should be considered lightweight and disposable and can be opened and closed at will.

You should `defer` the closing of each session  object using the `PanicOnClosureError()` function, which will release any underlying TCP connections held by the session object once the surrounding context has completed.

This practise should also be followed when you are finished using the driver instance.

.Session Lifecycle
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tags=driver,close,indent=0]

// Open a new Session
session := driver.NewSession(ctx, neo4j.SessionConfig{})
defer PanicOnClosureError(ctx, session)
----


== Running a Sample Query

To run a one-off Cypher query, you can use the `session.Run()` method.

.Running a One-off Query
[source,go,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=oneoff]
----

The method accepts four arguments:

1. The execution context.
2. A string to represent a Cypher statement
3. Optionally, a map representing query parameters (prefixed in Cypher with `$`)
4. Also optional, a map containing transaction config.


[WARNING]
.For one-off queries only
If there are any transient errors when running a query, the Driver will not attempt to retry a query when using `session.Run()`.
For this reason, these should only be used for one-off queries and not in production.

=== Processing Results

The `result` value in the code sample above will be an implementation of the `ResultWithContext` interface.
This can be used in conjunction with the  `neo4j.CollectTWithContext()` function to access the values returned by Neo4j.
The function expects a context object, a `ResultWithContext` object, and an accessor function.

The function is passed one argument, an instance of `neo4j.Record`, which can be passed to the `neo4j.GetRecordValue()` method.

.Accessing Results
[source,go,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=oneoffresult]
----


In the code sample above, the `p` value is extracted from each node using the `neo4j.GetRecordValue()` function, which is assigned to the `person` variable.
In this instance, `p` refers to a Neo4j Node, which is is hydrated into an instance of the `neo4j.Node` interface.

Should the `p` key not exist on the record, or any other error occurs while trying to retrieve the value, the subsequent error will be assigned to the `err` variable.


We will cover result processing further in link:../3-execute[Lesson 3: Read and Write Transactions^].


// == Closing the Driver

// The Driver provides a `.close()` method.
// Calling this function will close any open sessions, disconnect all servers and release any resources held by the driver.

// .Running a One-off Query
// [source,go,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
// ----
// include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=close]

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned the basics of the Neo4j Go Driver, how to install the dependency, create a new Driver instance and run a sample query.

In the next lesson, you will use this knowledge to query a Neo4j Sandbox instance.
