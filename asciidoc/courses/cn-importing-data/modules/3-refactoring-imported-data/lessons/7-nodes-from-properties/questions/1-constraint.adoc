= 1. Constraints

Why do you add a uniqueness constraint to the graph prior to creating nodes?

* [x] A best practice is to have a unique ID for a node of a given type in the graph.
* [ ] It enables you to generate a unique ID for every node.
* [x] It prevents duplicate nodes when you create them in the graph.
* [x] It speeds up `MERGE` performance.
