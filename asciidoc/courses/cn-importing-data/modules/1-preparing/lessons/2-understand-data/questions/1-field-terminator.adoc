= 1. Delimiting fields in CSV files

Suppose your CSV file uses the ";" character to separate the fields in the file.
What keyword do you use to tell `LOAD CSV` to use this delimiter?

* [ ] `WITH SEMI-COLON`
* [ ] `USE SEMI-COLON`
* [x] `FIELDTERMINATOR`
* [ ] `;` is the default so you need not specify anything additional in your `LOAD CSV` clause.
